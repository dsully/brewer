# Brewer üç∫

An extremly fast homebrew overlay with extra features.

This is a WIP, alpha, early-stage, etc. project. A lot is missing and bugs are
expected.

## Features

- Fuzzy formulae/cask search with an embedded [skim] ([fzf] rust alternative)
- Locate which formulae provides the given binary (Ubuntu's `command-not-found`
  equivalent)
- Much faster than `brew search` (uses [nucleo] crate for non-interactive fuzzy
  search)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:metafates/brewer.git
cd brewer

# using cargo
cargo install --path brewer_term

# or using `just`
just
```
